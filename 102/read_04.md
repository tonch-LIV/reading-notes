## Wireframe & Design

When talking about wireframing, it's easy to compare the practice akin to a *storyboard* used in movies or shows.  
A wireframe is a real bare bones, rough draft for the **potential layout** for **how** one plans to ***display the content*** on their website, top to bottom. So barebones that it does not take into consideration colors or actual content (words or graphics), simply how it's laid out and how the user will flow through the site.  

It is up to the design (team) to cater to the target audience and provide an **experience** that will engage them and allow them to accomplish their goal by providing whatever they may be looking for. This is done by not only providing relevant content, but also a tranquil and relatively easy to maneuver layout. Similarly, this same practice can be used when designing apps or any other product.  

This design process may take many attempts of trial and error though collaboration with those on the same team or input and feedback from the target demographic, and can be done the old fashioned way by use of ***pen and paper*** (which may be faster and more cost-effective), but many **digital tools** and resources exist so that one may do this with the use of a **GUI** through a website or similar.  

How you make a wireframe is a personal choice; some might benefit from ways others don't and different situations call for different solutions and approaches. It might be a good idea to view examples of other wireframes to help breed creativity in your own design process.

### Tools / Resources

- Pen & paper (plus examples).
- InVision: great for collabaration & feedback.
- UXPin: easy to build and use prototypes right in web browser.
- Wireframe.cc: digital pen and paper right in web browser.
- Balsamiq: simple design elements that focus on user flow.

### Making a wireframe in 6 steps

1. **Research** - who is the target audience? What is the goal in using your product? who else is doing what you're planning? UX trends (experiment and try new features)
2. **Format research** in easy-to-read manner - make cheat sheets to have on hand and reference regarding business and user goals, user feedback, features, use cases, etc.
3. **Map user flow** - what brings users to your product? how will you provide what they hope to gain/learn? and where will they go afterwards?
4. **Remember, It's a draft** - keep details to a minimum. focus on organizing layout (what is most important and should be seen first), organize different kinds of content (apples to apples, oranges to oranges; unless otherwise needed).
5. **Testing** - pepper in some detail when ready to test and refine taste after trials.
6. **Prototypes** - intermediate phase before final product, content is gradually added and feedback is received from collaborators about experience.

### Key Principles

**Clarity. Confidence. Simplicity.**  
A good wireframe does the heavy lifting of allowing a user to experience and learn what the product is intended to represent (without you having to explicitly tell them), what it offers to the user/ how it fulfills their needs. It achieves this confidently by offering easy navigation, solid content and simple design; no extra fluff (design elements, links, graphics, etc.), visual enhancements should enhance the content, not distract from the main course.  

## Mozilla HTML Basics

**HTML** stands for **H**ypertext **T**ransfer **M**arkup **L**anguage and is used across the world wide web to build websites and format their content. Elements are used to wrap around text content and define its formatting throughout the structure of a site. Most, but not all, elements have an opening and closing tag (i.e. `<html>content</html>)`.

### Docs

Through the use of links, HTML documents are connected to each other, resulting in the world wide web. Websites are further enhanced by the use of other tools/languages like **CSS** for styling and presentation, and **Javascript** for behavior, responsive elements and functionality.

### Elements

HTML shares a lot of similarities with markdown, changes only in how certain elements are formated and specified.

## Semantics

The meaning of a piece of code. What effect does running/including a certain piece of code have in its final output. Elements that have an implied (or learned) effect rather than a verbose descriptive name.

## Answer

1. What is HTML and why do we use it?
    - HTML stands for Hypertext Transfer Markup Language and is used across the world wide web to build websites and format their content.
2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
    - The three main parts of an HTML element are the tags (< >), the name of the element within, and closing tags (</ >)
3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
    - attributes
4. What is a semantic element?
    - the choosing or naming of an element that is not overly verbose/descriptive in name in relation to its output.
