## Career Coaching

### Launch Strategy

Use items such as:

- A professional pitch.
  - Why should they hire you? What do you bring to the table?
- Learn how to leverage and use your network connections.
  - Connections are powerful and can become advocates in pursuit of a role / company.
- Research companies to prepare for the interview.
  - Be ready to answer and ask questions about not only the position, but the company and perhaps the hiring manager as well.
- Review and prepare materials ahead of time.
  - If presenting documents or accreditations, make sure everything is in order well before they are needed or asked for.
- Demostrate professional competence.
  - Show you can work well in a shared environment and can collaborate with others / take instruction.

### Seven Pillars of Career Coaching

1. Etiquette
    - How to behave and what's expected in a work environment.
2. Pitch
    - Learning how to maximize your qualaties and how to talk about yourself to appear as an appealing candidate.
3. Network
    - Rather than just a blanket approach to applying; knowing who to talk to that could have information about roles looking to be filled. Using those connections to create an opening and stepping over the first huddle.
4. Preparing to Search
    - Learning how a typical job search is approached in the tech industry and how to become ready for what comes after filling out an application.
5. Targeted Search
    - Creating a detailed plan on where to dedicate time and resources to look for a fitting role.
6. Materials
    - Polishing Resume, Cover letters, Certificates/Ccertifications, online profile and any other accreditations to help create the best opportunity while searching.
7. Behavioral Questions
    - Demonstrating commitment and preparedness to the position based on past examples and/or experiences.
