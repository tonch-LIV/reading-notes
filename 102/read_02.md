## Choosing a Text Editor summary

A text editor is a helpful tool used to format text when writing code. Choosing a “good” one is all about preference over features present in one versus another.

The list of notable features is expansive, but a few important ones revolve around making the process of writing “easier” through extensions, syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.
As simple and basic as they may be, a good starting point would be to use the text editor that should come pre-installed with your computer’s OS & explore a few others to get a feel of what you need and what you prefer.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) exist in the world of text editors, but add more features such as being a file manager, a compiler, debugger all bundled together in one.

Once you begin writing code, make sure to use proper organization and naming conventions (root / branch directories and extension file types).

1. Four important features to look for in a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, and extensions.
2.  
    1. `pwd` - print working directory; tells you the current directory you are in/viewing
    2. `ls` - list; tells you the contents of current directory
    3. `cd` - change directory; followed by the name of directory you would like to move to, moves you there
        1. Running alone, without any “argument”, returns to home directory
        2. `cd.` -
        3. `cd..` - VV
    4. `mkdir` - make directory; creates directory (folder) within current directory. Cmd followed by “argument” will name directory as specified
    5. `touch` - used to create blank files if the named file does not exist.
3.
    1. `cd projects` - will move from current directory to ‘projects’ directory
    2. `mkdir new-project` - will make new directory named ‘new-project’ within current directory
    3. `touch new-project/newfile.md` -create new .md file named ‘newfile’ within new-project directory if it does not already exist and open it
    4. `cd..` - will move directory up one level; effectively a “back page” button
    5. `ls projects/new-project` - will list files within ‘new-project’ directory that is within ‘projects’ directory
