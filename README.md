### Growth Mindset
When faced with tasks or events of uncertainty or unknown to oneself, but curious to root their origin; that's what copmes to mind regarding growth mindset.</br>
Always being open to hearing, seeing, doing, and learning overall; regardless of new subjects or refreshing old material.</br>
All this to allow oneself to learn and grow from obstacles and challenges that weren't comfortable tackling or easily known before.</br>

#### Reminders
- <ins>Ask</ins> questions and <ins>Clarify</ins>
- Scale <sub>down</xub> or scale <sup>up</sup> after grasping concepts and looking to learn further.
- Use **Resources** to cement knowledge; whether it be peers or other materials. Be ***open minded*** to different approaches.

Name is [Antonio Garcia Pardo](https://github.com/tonch-LIV). I am expanding my skill set and knowledge reportoire in efforts to increase my hiring potential and further career prospects. I enjoy reading a good book, camping or just driving out in the woods, and working out; I recently started doing more cardio, so I'll be running around the neighborhood or hiking outdoors. I have an interest in IT infrastructure, networking, and troubleshooting or tinkering around with stuff.
