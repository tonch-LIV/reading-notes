### How do you make a ragout sauce?

> Ah, a ragout sauce—delicious! A ragout is essentially a slow-cooked, hearty sauce often used with meat, poultry, or vegetables. There are many variations (Italian, French, etc.), but the core idea is a flavorful, well-developed sauce with tender ingredients. Here’s a straightforward method:
>
> #### Basic Ragout Sauce Recipe
>
> ##### Ingredients (for 4 servings)
>
> - 2 tbsp olive oil or butter
> - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
> - 1-2 carrots, diced
> - 1-2 celery stalks, diced
> - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
> - 1 lb (450 g) meat of choice (beef, pork, lamb, or a mix), cut into bite-sized pieces
> - 1 cup (240 ml) dry white or red wine
> - 1 can (14 oz / 400 g) crushed tomatoes or tomato passata
> - 1-2 cups (240–480 ml) stock (beef, chicken, or vegetable)
> - 1-2 tsp fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, or parsley), chopped
> - Salt and pepper to taste
> - Optional: mushrooms, peas, or other vegetables
>
> ##### Instructions
>
>1. Sear the meat (if using):
>    - Heat olive oil in a heavy pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
>    - Brown the meat on all sides, then remove and set aside.
>2. Cook the aromatics:
>    - In the same pan, add onion, carrot, and celery.
>    - Sauté for 5–7 minutes until softened.
>    - Add garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
>3. Deglaze:
>    - Pour in the wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
>    - Let it reduce for 2–3 minutes.
>4. Add tomatoes and stock:
>    - Stir in crushed tomatoes and enough stock to cover the ingredients.
>    - Return meat to the pan.
>5. Simmer:
>    - Reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook gently for 1–2 hours, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.
>6. Finish with herbs and seasoning:
>    - Stir in fresh herbs and adjust salt and pepper.
>    - Optionally, add peas or mushrooms in the last 10–15 minutes.
>7. Serve:
>    - Over pasta, polenta, rice, or alongside crusty bread.
>
>#### Tips
>
> - For a richer flavor, add a splash of cream or a knob of butter at the end.
> - Ragout is forgiving—if it’s too thin, simmer uncovered to thicken.
> - The longer it simmers, the more the flavors meld.
